The update() gets the most recent event message from the eventQueue container.

The frames container holds the last three server updates for the entity.
Each item of the frames container holds the state data(position, rotation etc)
of the enitity for a given server update.


On a 'move' event, the state change data(position vector, rotation vector etc)
is pushed into the frames container.

The time period between each item in the frames container is the time,
after which it is expected for a new state frame to arrive.

In the render() method, the position for the current time is computed
by interpolating between the first(oldest) element in the frames container
and the next one available.
